# AsyncAwaitWinform
A simple comparison of using traditional c# code to async c# code.  


## Things to note
- This project is built using Visual Studio 2017, and I have not tested with other version of Visual Studio. Though the code should be perfect fine. 
- This program just counts the number of characters inside a text file at C:\Data\Data.txt
- This project uses .net 4.5.2
